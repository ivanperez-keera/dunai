synopsis:
  Generalised reactive framework supporting classic, arrowized and monadic FRP.
description:
  Dunai is a DSL for strongly-typed CPS-based composable transformations.
  .
  Dunai is based on a concept of Monadic Stream Functions (MSFs). MSFs are
  transformations defined by a function
  @unMSF :: MSF m a b -> a -> m (b, MSF m a b)@ that executes one step of a
  simulation, and produces an output in a monadic context, and a continuation
  to be used for future steps.
  .
  MSFs are a generalisation of the implementation mechanism used by Yampa,
  Wormholes and other FRP and reactive implementations.
  .
  When combined with different monads, they produce interesting effects. For
  example, when combined with the @Maybe@ monad, they become transformations
  that may stop producing outputs (and continuations). The @Either@ monad gives
  rise to MSFs that end with a result (akin to Tasks in Yampa, and Monadic
  FRP).
  .
  Flattening, that is, going from some structure @MSF (t m) a b@ to @MSF m a b@
  for a specific transformer @t@ often gives rise to known FRP constructs. For
  instance, flattening with @EitherT@ gives rise to switching, and flattening
  with @ListT@ gives rise to parallelism with broadcasting.
  .
  MSFs can be used to implement many FRP variants, including Arrowized FRP,
  Classic FRP, and plain reactive programming. Arrowized and applicative syntax
  are both supported.
  .
