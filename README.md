# Dunai

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivanperez-keera/dunai.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/ivanperez-keera/dunai)
[![Version on Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/dunai.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dunai)

This repository implements a generalized version of reactive programming, on
top of which other variants like Yampa, Classic FRP and Reactive Values can
be implemented.

# Installation

```
$ cabal sandbox init         # Optional, but recommended
$ cabal update
$ cabal install dunai
```

## Dependencies

Dunai currently support GHC versions 7.6.3 to 8.4.3.

# Examples

To test Dunai:

- Use `embed :: MSF m a b -> [a] -> m [b]` to collect
  a list with the results.

- Use `embed_ :: MSF m a () -> [a] -> m ()` to perform side effects without
  collecting the results.

- Use `reactimate :: MSF m () () -> m ()` when data is collected/provided by the
  MSF itself.

```haskell
ghci> import Data.MonadicStreamFunction
ghci> embed (arr (+1)) [1,2,3,4,5]
[2,3,4,5,6]
ghci> embed_ (arr (+1) >>> liftS print) [1,2,3,4,5]

ghci> reactimate (arrM_ getLine >>> arr reverse >>> liftS putStrLn)

# Structure and internals.

This project is split in three parts:

- _Dunai_: a reactive library that combines monads and arrows.
- _BearRiver_: Yampa implemented on top of Dunai.
- _Examples_: ballbounce, haskanoid
  - sample applications that work both on traditional Yampa and BearRiver.

We need to add examples of apps written in classic FRP, reactive values, etc. A
[new game](https://github.com/keera-studios/pang-a-lambda), in honor of Paul
Hudak, has been designed to work best with this library.

# Performance

Performance is ok, simpler games will be playable without further
optimisations. This uses unaccelerated SDL 1.2. The speed is comparable to
Yampa's.

It runs almost in constant memory, with about 50% more memory consumption than
with Yampa (200k for Yampa and 300K for dunai/bearriver). There is very minor
leaking, probably we can fix that with seq.

We have obtained different figures tracking different modules. In the paper, we
provided figures for the whole game, but we need to run newer reliable
benchmarks including every module and only things that live in FRP.Yampa,
FRP.BearRiver and Data.MonadicStreamFunction.

You can try it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ivanperez-keera/dunai.git
cd dunai
cabal sandbox init
cabal install
cabal install examples/bearriver
cabal install -f-wiimote -f-kinect -fbearriver examples/haskanoid
```

You may have to use `cabal sandbox add-source` and install all libs with one
`cabal install` invocation to link against the same versions of all common
dependencies.

# Contributions

We follow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Feel free to open new issues. We are looking for:

- Unexplored ways of using MSFs.
- Other games or applications that use MSFs (including but not limited to Yampa games).
- Fixes. The syntax and behaviour are still experimental. If something
  breaks/sounds strange, please open an issue.

# About the name

Dunai (aka. Danube, or Дунай) is one of the main rivers in Europe, originating
in Germany and touching Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania,
Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine.

Other FRP libraries, like Yampa, are named after rivers.  Dunai has been chosen
due to the authors' relation with some of the countries it passes through, and
knowing that this library has helped unite otherwise very different people from
different backgrounds.
