-- | 'MSF's with a 'Writer' monadic layer.
--
-- This module contains functions to work with 'MSF's that include a 'Writer'
-- monadic layer. This includes functions to create new 'MSF's that include an
-- additional layer, and functions to flatten that layer out of the 'MSF`'s
-- transformer stack.
--
-- It is based on the _strict_ writer monad 'Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict',
-- so when combining it with other modules such as @mtl@'s,
-- the strict version has to be included, i.e. 'Control.Monad.Writer.Strict'
-- instead of 'Control.Monad.Writer' or 'Control.Monad.Writer.Lazy'.
