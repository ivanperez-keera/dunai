-- | The 'ListT' monad transformer allows for branching effects.
--   For 'MSF's, this means that the continuation can branch in any tick.
--   This opens a (non-exhaustive) lists of possibilities:
--
--   * Several stream functions can run in parallel
--   * A stream function can split up into several ones
--     (e.g. in a simulation, this would correspond to the creation of objects)
--   * A stream function can decide to stop and delete itself
--
--   Some of the most important operations are given by the 'ArrowPlus' instance
--   of 'MSF's, which is usually available whenever 'ListT' is in the
--   transformer stack.
--   For example:
--
--   * @zeroArrow :: MSF (ListT m) a b@ corresponds to an empty list
--     of continuations
--   * @(\<+\>) :: MSF (ListT m) a b -> MSF (ListT m) a b -> MSF (ListT m) a b@
--     runs the two 'MSF's in parallel by appending the continuations.
--
--   Note though that the 'Monad' instance of lists is given by 'concat',
--   i.e. performing 'ListT' effects in subsequent ticks will result
--   in the cartesian products of the individual effects.
--
--   This module uses "'ListT' done right" as provided by the @list-t@ package.

-- * Entering the 'ListT' monad transformer

-- | For each input list element, create a cartesian product of identity arrows.
--
--   For example:
--
-- @
-- >>> let lists = [ [1,2,3], [10], [100, 101], [], [1000] ] :: [[Int]]
-- >>> embed (collect inListT >>> arrM print) lists
-- [1,2,3]
-- [10,10,10]
-- [100,101,100,101,100,101]
-- []
-- []
-- ...
