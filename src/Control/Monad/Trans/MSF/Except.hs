-- * Catching exceptions

-- | Catch an exception in an 'MSF'. As soon as an exception occurs,
--   the current continuation is replaced by a new 'MSF', the exception handler,
--   based on the exception value.
--   For exception catching where the handler can throw further exceptions,
--   see 'MSFExcept' further below.
catchS :: Monad m => MSF (ExceptT e m) a b -> (e -> MSF m a b) -> MSF m a b

  me <- liftMSFTrans msfe -< b
  inExceptT -< ExceptT $ return $ maybe (Right b) Left me

-- | Escape an 'ExceptT' layer by outputting the exception whenever it occurs.
--   If an exception occurs, the current 'MSF' continuation is tested again
--   on the next input.

--   it is passed on. If it is an exception, it is raised.

-- * Monad interface for Exception MSFs

-- | 'MSF's with an 'ExceptT' transformer layer
--   are in fact monads /in the exception type/.
--
--   * 'return' corresponds to throwing an exception immediately.
--   * '>>=' is exception handling:
--     The first value throws an exception,
--     while the Kleisli arrow handles the exception
--     and produces a new signal function,
--     which can throw exceptions in a different type.
--   * @m@: The monad that the 'MSF' may take side effects in.
--   * @a@: The input type
--   * @b@: The output type
--   * @e@: The type of exceptions that can be thrown
