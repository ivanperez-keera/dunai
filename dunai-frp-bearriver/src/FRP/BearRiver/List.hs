-- A ListSF is a signal function that produces additional information about
-- spawning and discarding SFs.
--
-- Each ListSF produces, apart from the normal output signal, two additional
-- outputs:
-- - A boolean signal indicating if it's still alive or not.
-- - A list of new SFs that have spawned at that point.
