-- | As described by Winograd-Court in his PhD thesis,
-- a wormhole consists of a data sink and a data source which are linked
-- by a synchronisation mechanism.
-- The aim of this technique is to abstract from the particular mechanism
-- of synchronisation and supply an interface
-- that is free of deadlocks and race conditions.
--
-- Often, an external reactive framework may have several parallel loops,
-- for example, OpenGL with a display callback,
-- an idle callback and a keyboard callback.
-- In such cases, one would like to let the different parts communicate.
-- This is done through a wormhole, which is a shared mutable variable
-- that can be written from one part and read from the other.
--
-- An example implementation is given for 'IORefs'.
-- Usually, the implementation is straightforward
-- for other synchronisation methods.
-- A word of caution has to be said though,
-- against using _blocking_ synchronisation mechanisms,
-- such as 'MVar's, for wormholes. In typical use cases,
-- the side effects of the sink and the source
-- have to be assumed to be non-blocking, ruling e.g. 'MVar's out.

-- | A wormhole consists of two monadic stream functions,
-- a sink and a source. It should satisfy the following properties:
--
-- * The data sent into the sink is transferred to the source
--   by means of side effects in @m@.
-- * In case of 'IO', sink and source are non-blocking.

  { sink   :: MSF m a ()
  , source :: MSF m () b
  }

-- | Creates a wormhole that encapsulates an initialised 'IORef'.
-- No synchronisation guarantee is made,
-- so the 'IORef' could be updated several times, or not at all,
-- before it is read again.

-- | Create a wormhole encapsulating an 'IORef' storing a 'Monoid'.
-- Every input is (atomically and strictly) 'mappend'ed to the stored value,
-- and whenever output is requested, the stored value is retrieved

-- | Creates two wormholes with 'IORef's at each end of the stream function
-- and runs the inner stream function in a separate thread.
-- It returns the outer stream function, which can be used

-- from the other thread, and a method to kill the thread.
-- As for 'newWormholeIORef', there is no synchronisation guarantee.
